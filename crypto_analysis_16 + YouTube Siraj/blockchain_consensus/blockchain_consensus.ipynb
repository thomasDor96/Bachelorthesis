    "#### The Yin:\n",
    " - AI is about machines doing educated guesswork for us\n",
    " - Machines “learn” by processing training datasets \n",
    " - Probabilistic methods that head in the direction of most likely reality\n",
    " - AI algorithms are central to goals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Yang:\n",
    " - Blockchains are more about validation, permanence and greater degrees of certainty and control.  .\n",
    " - An immutable, verifiable Ledger\n",
    " - Intelligence discovers opportunities & blockchains validate them and \n",
    " - Validates identities & transactions, automate the validation and generate the audit trail that goes back as far as the chain does.\n",
    " - Blockchain algorithms merely a means of permanently validating and recording transaction truth. \n",
    " - blockchain data = canonical reference for who did what when, why, & for how much.\n",
    " \n",
    "AI provides the educated guesswork to make sense of a complicated business environment and suggest a path forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blockchain by contrast would play the role of the truth teller, guarantor and mediator, the one bringing two parties together to forge and document an agreement immutably. Distributes trust across many nodes.\n",

    "- The smart contract intializes the model itself. Because the wieghts are randomly intialized by the smart contract and all the information used to intilaize the weights is public, there are no hidden secrets inside the homomorphic encryption that our startup could embed to make it so that the model secretly memorizes the data. \n",
    "- The smart contract sends the model spec to the oracle\n",
    "- The oracle generates a public private key pair, encrypts the model, then sends it back to the smart contract\n",
    "- After training on all the users, the model is sent to the oracle, its decrypted, encrypted with the oracle’s keys, then sent back. \n",
    "- Since the oracle acts as a trusted third party, no one can decrypt the model or gradients. \n",

    "- In proof of work (PoW) based public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and the current implementation of Ethereum), the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining). \n",
    "- In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake). \n",
    "- Significant advantages of PoS include security, reduced risk of centralization, and energy efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a proof of stake algorithm looks as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators\n",
    "- Anyone can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their coin into a deposit\n",

    "- at the end of the process all (honest and online) validators permanently agree on whether or not any given block is part of the chain. \n",
    "- Blocks may still be chained together; the key difference is that consensus on a block can come within one block, and does not depend on the length or size of the chain after it.\n"
